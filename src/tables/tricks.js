  "Laser Focus":
    "You can opt to use Intelligence to attack with high- tech weapons, and increase their crit hit range by 1. If you don't have a high-tech weapon—what luck!—you just found a laser (d6, crit on 18-20 for you, drain battery to deal damage)",

Once per round, you can can use an action to issue a simple command (like 'fetch' or 'attack'), or get advantage to a defense roll in combat. If your wastoid would die, choose whether the pet sacrifices themself to save you, or chooses a new master.",
